# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

The task at hand was to create a command-line application that generates a logo in the form of an SVG file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. In addition to this, another requirement was to use Jest to test the classes that were constructed. This project was built to save freelance developers money and time from paying a graphic designer a fee in order to design a company logo. This is achieved by prompting the user to answer a series of questions so that the logo can be tailored to the exact specifications of their desire.

## Usage

The objectives that were completed to fulfill in creating an SVG logo maker are as follows...

- Created prompts for the user to answer where the generator could design the logo to the exact sepcifications
- After the prompts have been completed, display the logo in the form of an SVG file that matches the user's inputs
